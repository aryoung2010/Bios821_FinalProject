## BIOS821 Final Project: European Soccer Database
### Allison Young
#### November 2019

### Description

This repository contains code to retrieve and organize data from a kaggle resource of soccer data, 
found at https://www.kaggle.com/hugomathien/soccer.

### Getting Started

This repository does not contain any actual data. Thus, in order to use this code, you must first download the database
from https://www.kaggle.com/hugomathien/soccer. From there, the code may be used to automate the rest of the process.
